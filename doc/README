mousee is a suite of Python files that reconstructs MicroMouse wall information
from a set of perspective images using OpenCV. The main script is called driver.py
and can be run as follows:

    python src/driver.py data/m7 out.txt

Note: All code was written in Python 2.7

Note: Right now, only data set m7 works. I'll be working to clean things up as
soon as I can find time.
